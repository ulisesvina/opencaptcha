# OpenCaptcha

## What is OpenCaptcha?

OpenCaptcha is a serverless captcha for static websites. It's fast, lightweight and mostly secure.

## License

OpenCaptcha is under MIT license.

## Usage

This is (personally) my favorite part of OpenCaptcha, you just need **two lines** of code to add OpenCaptcha to your website.
