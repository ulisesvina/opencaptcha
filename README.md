# OpenCaptcha

OpenCaptcha is an serverless (yes, no server needed!) library for protecting your website against bots. You just have to add two lines of code before a submit button and you're done!

## Usage

```
<!-- OpenCaptcha Goes Here >
<opencaptcha formid="captcha-form"></opencaptcha>
<script src="https://min.gitcdn.link/repo/ulisesvina/opencaptcha/master/src/opencaptcha.js"></script>
<!-- OpenCaptcha Goes Here >
<input type="submit">
```

## License

OpenCaptcha is under MIT license.

## Notes

OpenCaptcha is still in beta, I'm going to update it once every 3 months with awesome new features, also, I'll be working on a non-serverless Catpcha API with AI integrated, so it will be a lot more secure.
